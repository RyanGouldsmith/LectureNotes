NoSQL by Edel 
================
- Not a relational database.
Characteristics:
- Largevolumes of data 
- variable traffic 
- No schema - what tables and what columns are in those tables
- Partition tolerance  - can move to different disks easier.
- Various data models 
- Various query languages
- Eventual consistency
Advantages:
- making use of commodity servers, and run the database across these servers. 
- Handle higher volumes of dataand higher transactions rates than rdms 
- Less need for db administrators 
- lower startup costs 
- lower expansion costs
- few is any data model restrictions.
DisAdvantages: 
- Lack expert support because it's only been around for ashort while, expertise is scoped to the choice of nosql system.
- Many Data manipulaiton languages:
	- reduces portability of queries. 
	- reduces transferability of skills 
- no schema, reduces database maintainability 
- no normalization challenges consistency 
- wholedocument emphasis challenges analysis of data sets.
reasons to use NoSql:
- Low cost scaling 
- Data doesnt lend itself to conventional normalization: character large objects and binary large objects
- Large amounts of temporary data: incomplete forms. 
- Reduced needs for transactions.
