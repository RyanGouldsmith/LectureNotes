Steganography and Steganalysis by Nitin 
========================
- Steganography is not an encryption technique:
	- Art of hiding theexistence of a message rather than its meaning 
	- Hides within an object, text or a picture. 
	- Encypted file may still hide information using this. 
	- Digital watermarking is a very latest branch of this - usedto copyright and protect digital images, music and software 
- Digial Watermarking: 
	- faint logo or words superimposed over the top of an image 
	- Visible watermark is where you can see the copyright and users name 
- Steganography vs cryptography: 
	- Steganography: 
		- Hides message so it can#t be seen 
		- Data hidden in picture, Video, text file etc
		- After hiding the message
	- Look at slides. 
- Benefits of Steganoraphy: 
	- Implemented as a tool of plausible deniability:
		- Act which leaves little or no evidence of wrong doing or abuse 
		- In computers refers to data which the owner can deny its existence. 
	- Soliders and Intelligence agents may be captured and toured into revealing cryptograph keys and other secrets 
	- Police can misuse their power. 
	- Private individuals have been tortured by robbers. 
	- All the above can hide information using steganography
- Methods: 
	- hiding a file within a file (software)
		- Replacing Least Significant Bit
			- Some bits or bytes are not really needed or are not very important 
			- These can be replaced with information that is to be hidden 
			- Doesn't significantly alter the file
			- 10-15%
			- Doesn't increase the size of the file 
		- Injection Based
			- Data is added normally at the end of the file that increases the size of the file. 
	- Hiding all Files (Operating Systems)
		 - Steganographic File Sytem: 
			- similar to any traditional file system. 
			- Hide some files, not all files. 
			- Under development.
