Java API pesistence by Edel
==================
- An application has a data model 
- Needs pesistent dataa
- Impedence mismatch: the data might be mismatched when we store and process the data.
- Extend high level language by embedding query language statements in the language 
- Extend the query language with a programming language consatruct. Server side database action 
- Call level interace from a programming langaueg 
- persistence layer: clean separation of the logical application and the persistent data storage
Call level Interface: 
- Handle on the db
- Send queries 
- process the queries.
JBDC:
- Driver manager implements conenction, statement and result set
- Connection acts as a handle
- statement enables creation execution
Java Persistence: 
- CLI theres explicit translation between database table and programming language 
- Database and application program are designed separately and ade to work together
- Queries are represented as strings int he application
- persistence layer provides a clearerseparation between teh application logic and database 
- api allows us to design with obects and have the library function deals with the translation to and from the tables.
