XML and Data by  Edel
==================
- relational database is structured. 
- every day lift falls into sem-structured.
- Not all data falls into a relational schema. 
- XML makes searching by meaning possible, by implementing concepts derived from the strudy of semi-structured data 
- XML is emerging as a standard for data exchange between different applications.
- examples of semi structured data: 
	- minutes of meetings, poster for a show, car for sale, need a housemate, module description.
- Some structure:
	- entity instances are grouped together, 
	- elements are fairly well understood 
	- instandces have similar elements
- Irregular:
	- elements may occur in any order 
	-  elements may be missing 
	- elements dont have the same form.
