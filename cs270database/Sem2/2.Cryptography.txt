Nitin Lecture 4th February 12:00:
	- Encryption is the conversion of data from plain readable text to cipher text (un readable) that cannot be easily understood by unauthorised people. Plain text -> Cipher text.
	- Needs a lot of mathematics. 
	- Caesar Cipher uses an Encryption Key to increment the values to new values. eg. 
		EK = 3.
		a + 3 -> d. 
	- Decryption is the opposite. Cipher text -> Plain text.
	- Use the opposite Encryption key to decrement the values eg.
		EK = -3.
		d -3 -> a
	- Cryptography is the principle and method of transforming plain text to ciphers or codes.
	- Plain text: Normal information 
	- Ciphertext: the transformed text after encryption. 
	- Cipher: Any method (algorithm) for tranforming text -> ciphertext. 
	- Key: Is a sequence of symbols or bits which control the operation of the cryptographic algorithm to transform. 
		- secure this key. 
	- Cryptanalysis: The hackers way of getting information from cryptography code. 
		- The art of tranforming cipher text -> plain text without having information about the key. 
		- You can have Ethical cryptananalyst for the good, to make sure it's secure. 
		- To move cryptography forward we need constant work from cryptographers and cryptanalysts. 
	- 2 simple approaches for cryptanalysis:
		1. Brute Force (password attack)
			- Trial and error, doesn't try to decrpyt the plaintext but guess work to get keys, passwords etc.
			- They are useful for keys and passwords etc, but they can take hours, weeks or years.
			- More complicated passwords and keys the longer it will take.
			- Try out Every combination
			- Need a fast and powerful computer to be effective. 
			- Window Server OS example: 
				- 50% of the hackers work is helped by Microsoft. 
				- They only need to work out the password, since MS give out the Administrator account username. 
				- Even if you change the account name the SID(security Idenifier) will remain the same. 
				- Examine the SIDs to work out what has been changed. 
				- Can brute force the account without having issues of being locked out.
				- Solutions:
					- Change password frequently 
					- Renaming Administrator (Dangerous technique) : Read lecture slide
					- Security Accounts Manager (Dangerous technique) : Read Lecture Slide.
					- Move the Active Directory to a remote location, making it harder to find. 
			- Linux Fedora: 
				- SSH provides secure remote login capability that encypts connection setup and password.
				- look at slides for the 2 solitions. 
		2. Frequency Analysis Attack (text attack)
			- technique to determine the frequency of letters/groups of letters in a ciphertext.
			- After knowing a frequency of letters then plaintext could easily be retrieved. 
			- Used to break most cipher texts

Lecture 2: 12:00 5th February: Algorithms
-------------------------------
Types of Cryptography:
	- Classical : applied on text, or characters.
		- Oldest Techniques 
		- Substitution technique : Replace plain text with another symbol
			- Replaced one at a time.
		- Transposition : Re-arrange the order of the text.
			- Applies a permutation function to the text.
			- Uses 2/3 Rail Fence technique.
		- Product : Combination of substitution and transposition
	- Symmetric 
	- Asymmetric 
	- One-way Cryptography
- XOR is used widely: 
- Rotation/ Shift Method: Used with Registers.Right or Left Shift. Encryption key is the number of times you shift the bits.
- P-Box (Permutation) Replace the letter index with anothers.
- Shanon's Theory of Confusion and Diffusion:
	- Confusion:
		- Relationship can be made complex between ciphertext and key 
	- Diffusion:
		- Relationship can be made complex between ciphertext and plaintext.
- Round Product is used in modern techniques.
		- S&P box is used. Use SBox and PBox many times and comes out with a complex output.
		- Different subkey for each different round, created with help of the main encryption key.
		- 
- Encoding and Decoding
------------------------------------------
Lecture 11th February 2014: 12:00 continued:
------------------------------------------
	- Non-Feistal Cipher or SP-Network
		- Based on block encoding. 
		- You have a plain text split into blocks with each block being a x bit size
		- You then encrypt each block at a single time.
		- Plain Text XOR Round subkey
		- XOR on the block with the round key for that block.
		- Break the block into bytes. 
		- You will apply the S-BoX ad P-Box on each of the bytes.
		- Then you have a cipher text
		- Used in AES
	- Feistal Cipher or Feistal Network. 
		- Based on block encoding. 
		- You have a plain text split into blocks with each block being a x bit size
		- The Blocks are then split into two, called Left and right.
		- The 32 bit goes to an E-Box
		- This gets expanded to 48 bits. 
		- XOR the 48 bits with the key of the 48 bit.
		- Applie the XOR resultant to the S-BOX, which converts the 48bit to the 32 bit and P-BOX.
		- All encryption is done on the right 32 bit.
		- used in DES 
		- Swap the data, so the right becomes left and right becomes left. 
	- Both are used in symmetric key cryptography. 
	- Types of SKC:
		- Steam or Bit-Wise: slow 
		- Block Ciphers: Non-Feistal and Feistal.
			- DES, TRIPLE DES, AES.
		- DES:
			- 1st Standard 
			- 1970's developed by IBM. 
			- Public choice from NBS/NIST.
			- Ended in 1997 when a computer broke the algorithm.
		- TRIPLE DES: 
			- Slow
		- AES: 
			- Replaces DES
			- 5 algorithms selected for final. Rijndael Selected by NIST
			- Flexible with the Key size: 128, 192 or 256 Bit.
	- AES HEADING SOMETHING ?
		- 128 bit represented as a 4x4 matrix
		- Each matrix location holds one byte, 8 bit data 
		- This doesn't encrypt the data. 
		- Performs the operation as a state.
		- Perform the S-POX, P-BOX, then the P-Box again. 
		- First operation is sub-byte, 
		- Second is Shift the row (circular shift), then Third operation is shift the column
		- 1st row is 1 shift, 2nd row is 2 shift, 3 row is 3shift
		- bytes by byte operation.
		- 1st: Matrix - sub-byte > S-BOX > look up >  P-box > 2nd: Then shift the row > then p-box > 3rd: Column shift > 4th: Use the round key.

AKC/PKC
- decrpyts using the private key (asymmetric)
	- slower
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange: 
	- enables parties at both ends to derive or calculate a shared, secret/private ket without ever sending it to eachother
	- No real world solution
	- Agreed on a common number for a letter 
	- Private number: they're different. 
	- Raise powers of private number by the common number 
	- Send the resultant values to eachother.
	- Calculate the key at their own end by raising the resultant's power by their own number.
- RSA Algorithm:
	- many digital signatures use this. 
	- Select any 2 largest prime number p and q. ex.p=17 q = 11. 
	- Calculate common number n = p.q => 17.11 = 187.
	- Calculate totient function -> (p-1)(q-1) = (16 x 10 ) = 160
	- Select public/encryption key e
		- 1 < e < totientfunction AND hcf/gcd(e, totientfunction) = 1
	- Calculate private/ decryption key d 
		- e.d = 1 mod totentfunction
	- Encryption m < modulas number. => c = M^e mod n
	- Decryption ciphertext => m = c^d mod n 
- One-Way cryptography (Hash Functions)
	- mathematicals transformation to irreversibly encrypt infomration 
	- takes binary data and produces a condenced representation called the MD(MEssage Digest)/Hash
	- Always the same length
