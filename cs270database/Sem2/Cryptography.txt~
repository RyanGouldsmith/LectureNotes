Nitin Lecture 4th February 12:00:
	- Encryption is the conversion of data from plain readable text to cipher text (un readable) that cannot be easily understood by unauthorised people. Plain text -> Cipher text.
	- Needs a lot of mathematics. 
	- Caesar Cipher uses an Encryption Key to increment the values to new values. eg. 
		EK = 3.
		a + 3 -> d. 
	- Decryption is the opposite. Cipher text -> Plain text.
	- Use the opposite Encryption key to decrement the values eg.
		EK = -3.
		d -3 -> a
	- Cryptography is the principle and method of transforming plain text to ciphers or codes.
	- Plain text: Normal information 
	- Ciphertext: the transformed text after encryption. 
	- Cipher: Any method (algorithm) for tranforming text -> ciphertext. 
	- Key: Is a sequence of symbols or bits which control the operation of the cryptographic algorithm to transform. 
		- secure this key. 
	- Cryptanalysis: The hackers way of getting information from cryptography code. 
		- The art of tranforming cipher text -> plain text without having information about the key. 
		- You can have Ethical cryptananalyst for the good, to make sure it's secure. 
		- To move cryptography forward we need constant work from cryptographers and cryptanalysts. 
	- 2 simple approaches for cryptanalysis:
		1. Brute Force (password attack)
			- Trial and error, doesn't try to decrpyt the plaintext but guess work to get keys, passwords etc.
			- They are useful for keys and passwords etc, but they can take hours, weeks or years.
			- More complicated passwords and keys the longer it will take.
			- Try out Every combination
			- Need a fast and powerful computer to be effective. 
			- Window Server OS example: 
				- 50% of the hackers work is helped by Microsoft. 
				- They only need to work out the password, since MS give out the Administrator account username. 
				- Even if you change the account name the SID(security Idenifier) will remain the same. 
				- Examine the SIDs to work out what has been changed. 
				- Can brute force the account without having issues of being locked out.
				- Solutions:
					- Change password frequently 
					- Renaming Administrator (Dangerous technique) : Read lecture slide
					- Security Accounts Manager (Dangerous technique) : Read Lecture Slide.
					- Move the Active Directory to a remote location, making it harder to find. 
			- Linux Fedora: 
				- SSH provides secure remote login capability that encypts connection setup and password.
				- look at slides for the 2 solitions. 
		2. Frequency Analysis Attack (text attack)
			- technique to determine the frequency of letters/groups of letters in a ciphertext.
			- After knowing a frequency of letters then plaintext could easily be retrieved. 
			- Used to break most cipher texts

Types of Cryptography:
	- Classical : applied on text, or characters.
		- Oldest Techniques 
		- Substitution technique : Replace plain text with another symbol
			- Replaced one at a time.
		- Transposition : Re-arrange the order of the text.
			- Applies a permutation function to the text.
			- Uses 2/3 Rail Fence technique.
		- Product : Combination of substitution and transposition
	- Symmetric 
	- Asymmetric 
	- One-way Cryptography
- XOR is used widely: 
- Rotation/ Shift Method: Used with Registers.Right or Left Shift. Encryption key is the number of times you shift the bits.
- P-Box (Permutation) Replace the letter index with anothers.
- Shanon's Theory of Confusion and Diffusion:
	- Confusion:
		- Relationship can be made complex between ciphertext and key 
	- Diffusion:
		- Relationship can be made complex between ciphertext and plaintext.
- Round Product is used in modern techniques.
		- S&P box is used. Use SBox and PBox many times and comes out with a complex output.
		- Different subkey for each different round, created with help of the main encryption key.
		- 
- Encoding and Decoding
