Javascripting by Hannah Dee
================
- Frameworks can simplify stuff in Javascript 
- variables don't have to be declared 
- Not really OO
- External files can help with caching, page load times can be a bit quicker
- No strict case of inheritence
- Can use the Number(int) function to turn a string into a number 
       - Same as with .parse
- Can use typeofto show the typeof a variable 
- requestAnimationFrame: requests a redraw, redraws as quick as the browser can do it.
