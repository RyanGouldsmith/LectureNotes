Data Types and Pointer and References Types by Jon Bell
=================
- fundamental Types:
	- Bool, char, int, float, double, enum
	- All can be signed or un-signed. 
- Stack : Just a Stack, lifo, 
- Heap : Bundle of data, has no order. All the objects go on the heap in java.
- cout is the c++ way of doing printf
- int &z = y means if you change z then you change y.
- in Java if you pass a primitive type to a method it passes by value, if it's an object that it passes by reference.
- by reference is & and *, by value is just the variable name. 
- malloc will go on the heap.
