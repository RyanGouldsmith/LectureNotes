Classes in C++ by Jon Bell
========================
- Define a class in a header file 
- Member function code is not on the heap/stack it's in the program area memory. 
- :: is the scope resolution operator. 
	- eg: 
		int ExampleClass::FunctionOne(void){
			foo;
		}
- When we write a member function call the compiler calls the function and tells the function which Object's data to use.
- Hide a class in a namespace, or an implementation file. Equivelent of a private/protected class. 
- Access is private by default for classes.
- ~(tilde) is the destructor. No garabage collector, we need this. Compiler will give you a default one. 
- Public: Anywhere
- Protected: Visual from within the class and from within derived classes 
- Private: Can only be accessed within the class their're declared.
- You can inherit using these specifiers

Cont. Jon Bell 
=========================
- Const means a that an object is not modfiable 
- Calls for Const Object are disallowed:
	- Unless the member functions themselves are declared const. 
	- True even for get memember that do not moidfy the object 
- if the method doesn't have a const, called by a const object it will reject as we dont know what it will do.
Friends: 
	- A friend function of class is defined outside that class' scope yet has the right to access the non-public members of the class. 
	- Standalone functions, entire classes/member functions of other classes may be declared to be friends of another class.
	- friendship is granted, not taken.
	- Noot symmetric or transitive.
