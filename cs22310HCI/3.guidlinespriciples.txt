Guidlines and priciples:
=========================
-Theories - High level: 
	- how HCI occurs
	- Descriptive, explanatory, predictive
- Principles - mid level:
	- applicable 
	- drive the development process
	- Analyze and compare the competingdesign 
- Guidelines - specific and practical: 
	- Curs design problems
	- cautions for potential danger 
	- Reminders based on experience.
Guidelines: Helps people by
	- developing a shared language

				- Multi-layer designs
				- Providing an interface for novice users and shortcuts for those who know the system
			- Identify the tasks
				- Task analysis: Obsersvation and Interviewing users. 
				- Helps designs: task frequencies and sequences. Tough decisions on support.
			- Choose an interaction style. 
				- Direct manipulation: Select line or attributes from a side bar and produce the result.
				- Menu Selection:
				- Form fill-in: Constrainting the user for information.
