Usability
====================
- Early emphasis on types of users and tasks they're going to be putting forward
- Move the detection of the problem needs real usability testing = reduced cost
- Activities: 
	- define thecontext, check feasibility 
	- understand the problem 
	- Design the solution 
	- Implementation 
	- Evaluation = Big step. 
	- Evaluate each section 
- SE vs UE (software eng vs usabil eng)
	- Se: 
		involves a system requireing a computerised solution
	- Design solution: architecture, algorithms 
	- Evaluation: tested for errors, mismatches
	- UE
		Involves understanding those tasks to be supported
	- Design solution: presentation and the delivery
	- Evaluation: test code in thesame way, Usability needs are satified, experiments
- Prototyping: 
	- Often produced: 
		- Clarification of requirements
		- Evaluation of usability 
	- Could be Paper, with no interaction and functionality 
	- Could be mock, interactive with dummy functionality.
- Detailed Design: 
	- SE: 
		- interacting processed
	- UE
		- Individuals interactions
		- Design of algorithms, data structure in ters f individual interation 
- Evaluation: 
	- SE: 
		- Testing of logical flow 
	- UE: 
		- Evaluation by experts, analysis, testing by users
		- Testing the logical flowand function of software to support interaction.
- Lifecycles: 
	- ModelsforSE often inadequatefor UE
		- Goals, interface evaluation, direct user envolvement
	- Star Life Cycle:
		- Analysis: Formal, organising, working from the system to the user 
		- Synthesis: Creative, free-thinking, working from the user to system.
