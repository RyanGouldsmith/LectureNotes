Design PrincipleS
=================
- 6 principles
- make functions visible
- If they're out of site then it is difficult for the user to find and use them.
Feedback:
- Keeping the user in the loop so the user knows what has just been done
Constraints:
- Restriciting the possibe ations that can be performed: greyed out items on a menu
- 3 types of Behaviour:
	1. Physical
		- Restrict the movement of things.		
	2. Logical 
		- Exploit people's everyday common sense about the way something works.
	3. Cultural 
		- Colours are a confusing one, they can mean different things in different cultures.
Mappings: 
	- Spatial relationship between the layout of the controls and which is being controlled.
Consistency:
 	- Design interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for similar tasks.
Affordance: 
	- Properties of Objets which provide clues to how they work.
