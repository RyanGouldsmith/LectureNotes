P=NP problem by Lynda Thomas
=============================
- Relatively Efficient: Polynomial time for all inputs. Mergesort requires N log N
- Get information for InEfficient algorithms
- Travelling Sales Person:
	- Given all N state capitals, can you finda route through them that costs < some amount.
		- Would have to try n! possibilites. => o(n!)
		- No Polynomial solution.
- Satifiability:
	- Assign values to a boolean expression in N variables that makes it true?
	- p && q is true when P is true and Q is true.
	- O(2^n) - try all the possibilities: not polynomial.
- NP: Set of all decision problems with polynomial checking algorithm.
	- set of all problems solvable in polynomial time on a Nondeterministic turing machine
- NP Complete-ness 
	- If there is a polynomial solution for this, then all the other NP would be solved by polynomial
