========================
Abstract Factory Pattern by Harry Strange
========================
- We want to create families of related objects without having to depend
CosequenceS: 
- exchangeable product families
- Consistency among the object 
- supporting new products is difficult
Factory method vs Abstract Fact:
	- Both good at decoupling 
	- Fact meth: Inheritence Abstract fact: Composition
	- Fact meth: single prodouct.

When to use Factory Method:
- decouple client code from concrete classes
- you dont know what conrete classes are needed
Abstract Factory:
- Create families of products
- Composition 
- used in creating portable cross platform guis
